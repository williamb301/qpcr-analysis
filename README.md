# qpcr-analysis

The script qpcr.py is used to take qpcr raw data (CT values + loading table setup) and output an excel file that contains 
average qpcr titer and standard deviation, along with a graph of the viral titer standard curve. Read the jupyter notebook
named qpcr-analysis-instructions.ipynb for more information on how to run the script.
